# SOCD-AHK Script

An AutoHotkey v2 script that implements SOCD (Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Direction) cleaning for keyboard input.  
Designed to provide consistent and predictable movement behavior in games and applications that rely on directional input.

---

## Features

- SOCD input resolution
- AutoHotkey v2 compatible
- Lightweight and fast
- Fully configurable
- Designed for keyboard-based movement systems
- Non-commercial open-source usage

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11  
- AutoHotkey v2.x  

Download AutoHotkey v2 from:  
https://www.autohotkey.com/

---

## Installation

1. Get a release from https://github.com/Ncoder-official/Snaptivity/releases
2. Unzip the zip file
3. Run `Compiled\Snaptivity.zip` or `SOCD.ahk` based on your needs
4. The script will create a `config` folder inside `SOCD.ini`
5. Comply with the on-screen instructions to set the script ready (first time only)
6. Press the SOCD key to toggle and the menu key to open the settings menu

### Windows SmartScreen Notice
This app is unsigned, so Windows may show a blue “Protected your PC” screen.
Click More info → Run anyway.
The source code is available and clean.
You can compile the ahk script itself if you don't trust the exe.

## Usage

This script resolves opposite directional inputs such as:

| Input | Output |
|------|--------|
| A + D | Neutral / priority-based resolution |
| W + S | Neutral / priority-based resolution |

(Exact behavior depends on your configured mode.)

Use this for:
- Fighting games
- Grid-based movement games
- Competitive keyboard input testing
- Custom control systems

## ⚠️ Important Notice - Bannable offense

Do **NOT** use this script in competitive online games such as:
- Valorant  
- CS:GO / CS2  

These games may consider SOCD behavior as unauthorized input modification.

## ⚠️ Important Notice 2 – Text Input

This script is **not recommended for use in textboxes or typing fields**.

The SOCD-AHK system works by duplicating and managing directional key events internally in order to correctly resolve conflicting inputs.  
Because of this design, using the script while typing will result in **double characters**.

# Settings

The SOCD-AHK script includes a built-in control panel that allows full configuration of all SOCD behavior in real time.  
All changes are saved automatically when the window is closed.

---

## Reselect SOCD Toggle Key  
Sets the main hotkey that enables or disables the SOCD system.  
This key controls whether the script is actively modifying input.

---

## Reselect Menu Toggle Key  
Sets the hotkey used to open the SOCD Control Panel.  
Allows quick access to settings without restarting the script.

---

## Edit HUD Position / Size  
Allows repositioning and resizing of the WASD HUD overlay.  
Useful for:
- Debugging
- Screen recording
- Personal layout preference

---

## Disable Tray Notifications  
Disables Windows tray notifications generated by the script.  
Recommended for:
- Recording
- Testing
- Reduced distraction

---

## Snappy Input Mode  
Reduces input lag by capturing physical keys for SOCD detection instead of logically checking IsDown

- ON: More Arcade-style feel on input may introduce lag on Weak Single-Core CPUs try compiling script or disablind it
- OFF: More intent based detection system generally not recommended for pro play

> Note: I was wrong Snappy Input mode has more effect than compiling it. But compiling on weaker hardware is still recommended.

---

## Lock Winner Opposites (W+S / A+D)  
Implements hardware-style SOCD locking behavior.  

When enabled:
- Once a direction wins, the opposite direction is locked out  
- The locked direction becomes active only after releasing and re-pressing  

This closely mimics real SOCD hardware behavior.

### IT WORKS AS OF VERSION 1.0.2 ANYTHING BEFORE = GARBAGE

---

## Split Direction Lanes (WS / AD)  
Processes vertical (W/S) and horizontal (A/D) inputs independently.

When enabled:
- Vertical and horizontal lanes use separate SOCD resolvers  
- Prevents interference between movement axes  
- Improves consistency in grid-based and 3D movement systems  

---

## Show WASD HUD Overlay  
Displays a visual overlay showing:
- Raw key inputs
- Active SOCD state
- Final resolved direction  

Useful for:
- Debugging
- Validation
- Demonstrations
### Cool fact
> It shows green highlights when SOCD is off then shows blue
---

## Override Mode  

Override Mode controls how the script resolves opposite directions when both are pressed.  
Instead of neutralizing or locking, it *overrides* one input with another based on a defined rule.  
Think of it as “which key gets authority when conflict happens.”

This mode is designed to simulate different SOCD behaviors found in real hardware controllers.

---

### 🔁 Last Input Wins  
The most recently pressed direction becomes the active output.

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output becomes `D`
- Press `D`, then press `A` → output becomes `A`
- Releasing the active key returns control to the still-held opposite key
- Releasing both keys returns to neutral

Use cases:
- Modern fighting controllers  
- Fast, responsive movement  
- Natural-feeling direction changes  

---

### 🧱 First Input Wins  
The first pressed direction remains active until it is released.

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output stays `A`
- `D` is ignored while `A` is held
- When `A` is released, `D` becomes active (if still held)

Use cases:
- Older SOCD implementations  
- More stable directional control  
- Prevents rapid flipping  

---

### Disable Input on override
Disables the input and neutralizes current keys state until repressed

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output neutralizes and becomes nothing
- Releasing `D` → `A` is still not active
- Releasing both `D` and `A` will reset the function

### Absolute Priority Mode
Always favours a set key over the other. Unique and Customizable of all the modes so far.

Behavior: (Assuming `A` is the set key)
- Press `A`, then press `D` → `A` is active and `D` gets neutralized
- Releasing `D` → `A` is unchanged and still active
- Releasing `A` will make `D` active


---

## Auto Save Behavior  

All settings are saved automatically when the control panel is closed.


All user-adjustable settings are stored in:
  `config\SOCD.ini`

Restarting is not nessecary unless changing the ahk script itself
