3. Run `Compiled\Snaptivity.zip` or `Snaptivity.ahk` based on your needs
4. The script will create a `config` folder, inside `Snaptivity.ini` and a `Core` folder
5. Comply with the on-screen instructions to set the script ready (first time only)
6. Press the SOCD key to toggle and the menu key to open the settings menu

### Windows SmartScreen Notice
This app is unsigned, so Windows may (I literally can't get it to show it so it's an actual may like ACTUAL MAY I tried downloading through internet still may) show a blue “Protected your PC” screen.
Click More info → Run anyway.
The source code is available and clean.
You can compile the ahk script itself if you don't trust the exe.

## Usage

This script resolves opposite directional inputs such as:

| Input | Output |
|------|--------|
| A + D | Neutral / priority-based resolution |
| W + S | Neutral / priority-based resolution |

(Exact behavior depends on your configured mode.)

Use this for:
- Fighting games
- Grid-based movement games
- Competitive keyboard input testing
- Custom control systems

## ⚠️ Important Notice - Bannable offense

Do **NOT** use this script in competitive online games such as:
- Valorant  
- CS:GO / CS2  

These games may consider SOCD behavior as unauthorized input modification.

## 🛠️ Input Handling Update – Bug Fixed + Legacy Mode Behavior

The triple-character input issue has been **fully fixed** in the default input system.  
SOCD-AHK now correctly processes directional key events without causing duplicated or multiplied characters while typing.

In normal mode:
- Textboxes and typing fields work as expected  
- Only **single characters** are produced  
- No more input cloning, no more keyboard chaos  

However…

### 🧪 Legacy Input Mode

A **Legacy Input Mode** toggle is available for compatibility and testing purposes.

When Legacy Input Mode is enabled:
- The old input behavior is restored partially  
- Directional key handling follows the original system  
- Typing in textboxes may produce **triple characters** instead of the original **double characters**  

This is intentional.

Legacy mode exists for:
- Backward compatibility  
- Debugging  
- Testing previous SOCD logic  
- Summoning the ancient bugs (optional) 🐉⌨️  

If you see triple characters:  
You are not experiencing a bug.  
You have activated **Legacy Input Mode**.

Switch back to normal mode to return to stable, single-character typing.

# Settings

The SOCD-AHK script includes a built-in control panel that allows full configuration of all SOCD behavior in real time.  
All changes are saved automatically when the window is closed.

![Snaptivity Settings menu](Snaptivity-Settings.png)

---

## Reselect SOCD Toggle Key  
Sets the main hotkey that enables or disables the SOCD system.  
This key controls whether the script is actively modifying input.

---

## Reselect Menu Toggle Key  
Sets the hotkey used to open the SOCD Control Panel.  
Allows quick access to settings without restarting the script.

---

## Edit HUD Position / Size  
Allows repositioning and resizing of the WASD HUD overlay.  
Useful for:
- Debugging
- Screen recording
- Personal layout preference

---

## Disable Tray Notifications  
Disables Windows tray notifications generated by the script.  
Recommended for:
- Recording
- Testing
- Reduced distraction
- Not being "the guy that queued 50000 traytips and cant open the tray to disable the script"

---

## Snappy Input Mode  
Reduces input lag by capturing physical keys for SOCD detection instead of logically checking IsDown

- TRULY-SNAPPY: Enables `EngineOverclock()` alongside snappy mode to gain maximum performance trading stability
- ON: More Arcade-style feel on input may introduce lag on Weak Single-Core CPUs try compiling script or disablind it
- OFF: More intent based detection system generally not recommended for pro play

> Note: I was wrong Snappy Input mode has more effect than compiling it. But compiling on weaker hardware is still recommended.

---

## Lock Winner Opposites (W+S / A+D)  
Implements hardware-style SOCD locking behavior.  

When enabled:
- Once a direction wins, the opposite direction is locked out  
- The locked direction becomes active only after releasing and re-pressing  

This closely mimics real SOCD hardware behavior.

### IT WORKS AS OF VERSION 1.0.3 ANYTHING BEFORE = GARBAGE

---

## Split Direction Lanes (WS / AD)  
Processes vertical (W/S) and horizontal (A/D) inputs independently.

When enabled:
- Vertical and horizontal lanes use separate SOCD resolvers  
- Prevents interference between movement axes  
- Improves consistency in grid-based and 3D movement systems  

---

## Show WASD HUD Overlay  
Displays a visual overlay showing:
- Raw key inputs
- Active SOCD state
- Final resolved direction  

Useful for:
- Debugging
- Validation
- Demonstrations

### Cool fact v2
> It now has modes try it and also figure out an easter egg I know you can.
---

## Override Mode  

Override Mode controls how the script resolves opposite directions when both are pressed.  
Instead of neutralizing or locking, it *overrides* one input with another based on a defined rule.  
Think of it as “which key gets authority when conflict happens.”

This mode is designed to simulate different SOCD behaviors found in real hardware controllers.

---

### 🔁 Last Input Wins  
The most recently pressed direction becomes the active output.

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output becomes `D`
- Press `D`, then press `A` → output becomes `A`
- Releasing the active key returns control to the still-held opposite key
- Releasing both keys returns to neutral

Use cases:
- Modern fighting controllers  
- Fast, responsive movement  
- Natural-feeling direction changes  

---

### 🧱 First Input Wins  
The first pressed direction remains active until it is released.

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output stays `A`
- `D` is ignored while `A` is held
- When `A` is released, `D` becomes active (if still held)

Use cases:
- Older SOCD implementations  
- More stable directional control  
- Prevents rapid flipping  

---

### ❌ Disable Input on override
Disables the input and neutralizes current keys state until repressed

Behavior:
- Press `A`, then press `D` → output neutralizes and becomes nothing
- Releasing `D` → `A` is still not active
- Releasing both `D` and `A` will reset the function

### 👑 Absolute Priority Mode
Always favours a set key over the other. Unique and Customizable of all the modes so far.

Behavior: (Assuming `A` is the set key)
- Press `A`, then press `D` → `A` is active and `D` gets neutralized
- Releasing `D` → `A` is unchanged and still active
- Releasing `A` will make `D` active

## ⚙️ Advanced Menu – Engine Control & Danger Zone

[Advanced Menu image LOL LMAO if you read this your browser is bad lmao](Snaptivity-adv-menu.png)

The Advanced Menu exposes low-level engine switches that directly affect how Snaptivity processes input internally.  
This is **not** for normal usage. These options exist for testing, debugging, stress experiments, and engine behavior research.

If the main menu is “user mode”, the Advanced Menu is **developer mode**.

Entering this menu means:
- Safety systems can be bypassed
- Engine stability can drop
- Input behavior can become unpredictable
- Crashes are no longer “bugs”, they are expected results

Use with awareness. Use with intention. Use with chaos. 🧠💀

---

### 🧟 Legacy Input Mode (Physical Passthrough)

Enables the old physical input routing pipeline.

Behavior:
- Physical keyboard input is no longer fully blocked
- The engine partially loses authority over key flow
- Typing may produce **triple characters**
- Input desync is possible
- SOCD logic becomes less deterministic

Purpose:
- Backward compatibility
- Debugging legacy behavior
- Reproducing old bugs
- Testing unsafe pipelines
- Or chaos

This mode is intentionally unstable.

---

### 📊 Engine Latency Profiler

Enables real-time measurement of Snaptivity’s internal execution latency.

When enabled:
- Each Send operation is timed using high-resolution (`QPC_Now`) counters
- A latency HUD appears under the WASD overlay
- You can see:
  - Last execution time
  - Average execution time
  - Number of samples

Purpose:
- Measure real engine performance
- Compare Normal vs Snappy vs Truly Snappy
- Detect spikes and instability

This measures **engine latency**, not network or game latency.

---

### 🛡️ SafeMod (Engine Supervision)

SafeMode enables the engine’s protection systems.

When enabled:
- Input burst limits are active
- Crash watchdog is active
- RAM state saving is enabled
- Auto-restart on crash is enabled
- Rate limiting prevents runaway Send storms
- Unstable with many inputs for now

This is the default and future recommended mode.
consider turning it off if you see StuckKeys that bypass checkstuck keys

---

### 💥 Crash Lab – Manual Crash Generator

Provides direct access to controlled crash types for testing engine recovery.

Available crash types include:
- Soft exception
- Hard process termination
- Infinite loop freeze
- Stack overflow
- Memory exhaustion
- Invalid DLL calls
- Timer storms
- Self-destruct & respawn

Purpose:
- Validate watchdog behavior
- Test crash recovery
- Stress the restart pipeline
- Validate RAM state restoration

This is not a bug feature.  
This is an **engine validation system**.

---

## Auto Save Behavior  

All settings are saved automatically when the control panel is closed.


All user-adjustable settings are stored in:
  `config\Snaptivity.ini`

Restarting is not nessecary unless changing the ahk script itself
